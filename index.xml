For many years before the blockchain, consensus algorithms have been used in distributed systems to achieve the desired technical properties of safety and liveness, while improving performance and reducing cost. However, with the advent of the blockchain technology, consensus algorithms are additionally important components of the governance model of the network infrastructure.</description></item></channel></rss>
